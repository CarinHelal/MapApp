							 Use HTTPS for all communications between the app and the server.
					
					Secure Authentication:	Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security.
								Use secure token-based authentication methods (e.g., JWT).

					Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
								 Keep all libraries and dependencies up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.

How will i create it? 
			      Main page to like a discord home page/chat stack that is public  
			      Another page would be for the events happening that week 
			      no chat feature in the app, people would have to share a social media account and chat with other on other social media platform 

			      Events would be gathered from popular sites that post events 
			      & user created events on Facebook or other social media sites that lets users create events(Eventbrite, meetup)
			      filters to sort events by age or hobby ex: 55+ events, kids events, youth events, adult events, music, sports 
	PRIVACY	
			      Allow users to control who can see their profile and activity (e.g., public, friends only, private).
			      Provide options to hide specific personal information (e.g., last name, contact info).

	EVENT PRIVACY	      Enable users to control the visibility of their event attendance (e.g., visible to friends, anonymous).
	
	SAFETTY		      reporting and blocking features
			      Establish clear community guidelines and terms of service / Communicate zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, and inappropriate behavior.
			      Use AI tools to detect and flag suspicious behavior or content.
