<h3>Map App</h3> is a social networking app focused on facilitating in-person meetups within the same city. 
Events are aggregated from several websites to provide all the information in one place. 

Only users with an existing social media account, can sign up. The app matches users with people who live within 5km of each other and who are within 5 years of age from each other. 
People can post to the main chat homepage what events they will be attending or check the Events page to see what events are happening in the next 3 days. 
People will be able to share who can see which events they will attend and who can see their profile and app activities. 


The Events page will have buttons to filter events by category, for example: 55+ events, kids events, youth events, adult events, music, sports. 
AI tools are used to detect and flag suspicious behavior or content.
